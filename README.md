# Heart_Attack_Analysis
This repository stores the jupyter notebook used for my data science project where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis and model predictions on [Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset).

The notebook can be viewed [here]([https://www.kaggle.com/code/vraghubir/ipl-batting-and-bowling-analysis-2016-2022](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vraghubir/heart-attack-analysis)). 

I also wrote articles explaining my analysis and the insights gained from this [here](). Will update this link once the medium article is written.
